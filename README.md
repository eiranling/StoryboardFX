## StoryboardFX (WIP)

StoryboardFX is a library built for JavaFX to create highly customisable storyboards in javaFX. All components provided are compatible with SceneBuilder as well.

## Importing StoryboardFX

StoryboardFX is currently unavailable for use unless you download the source code and build it. However, in the future, I will be releasing StoryboardFX to the central Maven repo.
